# Getting Started

Welcome! This template is designed for clarity and maintainability. Please read the [documentation philosophy](../../../index.md) before contributing.

## Quick Start

Use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to scaffold your project without git history:

```bash
npx degit MagicAceDev/magic-stack/templates/website-template my-project
cd my-project
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Pro Tips

1. **degit supports branches/tags:**
   ```bash
   npx degit MagicAceDev/magic-stack/templates/website-template#v1.0.0 my-project
   ```
   Replace `v1.0.0` with any tag or branch name to scaffold a specific version.
