# Database & Drizzle ORM

This template uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for type-safe SQL database access. **Why Drizzle?**

- Drizzle offers a SQL-like syntax, making it easy to reason about queries and migrations.
- It avoids the heavy abstraction of tools like Prisma, giving you more control and transparency.
- Drizzle works especially well with Turso & LibSQL, which are the default databases for this template.

> **Personal note:** Drizzle was chosen for its balance of power and simplicity. If you prefer raw SQL but want type safety and migrations, Drizzle is a great fit.
