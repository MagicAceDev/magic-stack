# {Your Site Name} Documentation

We recommend keeping the documentation close to the codebase, so it is easy to find and update. The documentation should be written in Markdown and placed in the `docs/` directory of the project.

If you want to read more about our documentation philosophy, check out the [MagicStack Technical Documentation](../index.md).
